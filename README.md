Some code for sharing and discussion


1. origin_menu.py briefly illustrates my first attempt at a daggerfall-style character generation process.

2. render_functions.py included to show the (very simple) usage of numpy objects in this function, and the rendering of a dynamic          tooltip console which should appear near the mouse cursor and switch sides if rendering offscreen.
